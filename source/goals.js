// everything right. So days are stamped client-side as 'YYYY-MM-DD' local, and
// everything downstream — including the server — treats that string as opaque.
//
// That also makes travel harmless. Cross a date line and you might get a short
// day or a long one, but you cannot lose a streak to arithmetic.
